# Image Processing Projects

Collection of projects for image processing tasks.

## Project Highlights:

- **Creative Image Filters:** Implementing various image effects using the OpenCV library in Python, you can apply Grayscale, Cartoonize, Blurred, Sharpened, and a range of other effects. Unleash your creativity with thermal vision, watercolor, cinematic, pencil sketch, lomo, and rainbow effects.
- **Edge Detection:** Explore the fundamental task of edge detection using OpenCV. Implementing techniques like Canny, Sobel, Laplacian, Kirsch, Robinson, Prewitt, and Roberts Edge Detection, this project allows you to visualize and understand boundaries within images.
- **Face & Eye Detection:** Detect faces and eyes in images using OpenCV and Haar cascades. This project provides functions to identify faces, eyes, or both in an image, offering a valuable tool for applications like facial recognition and security systems.
- **Image Steganography:** Explore the world of hidden messages with steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding technique. This project allows you to encode and decode secret messages within images, adding a layer of intrigue to your digital communication.
- **Image to Pencil Sketch:** Give your images an artistic touch by converting them into pencil sketches using OpenCV. This simple yet effective Python code can breathe new life into your photos, providing a unique and hand-drawn appearance.
- **Image Watermarking:** Protect your images and add a professional touch with this simple Python code for watermarking. Using the popular PIL (Pillow) library, you can easily incorporate watermarks into your images for branding or copyright purposes.
